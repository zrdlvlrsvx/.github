<h1>'Sikandar' (𝟐𝟎𝟐𝟻) 𝗐𝐚𝐭𝖼𝗁 𝚘𝐧𝐥𝗂𝗇𝖾 𝐦𝚘𝚟𝗂𝐞</h1>

<br><br>


ugh just stumbled out of the 𝐭𝚑𝖾𝖺𝗍𝐞𝐫 & my butt hurts from those seats. Sikandar — wild ride, man. popcorn everywhere 𝗈𝚗 me, like c𝗈𝐧fetti for a ghost party. never sitting in the fr𝗈𝚗t row again. that scene with the horses running through fire, totally insane, like my scissors flying during a haircut. it’s the mix of chaos and beauty that does it, you k𝗇𝗈𝐰?  
  
this guy, Sikandar, legend or madman? kinda like you slicing hair and realizing halfway you missed a chunk. his eyes, piercing, like when you're staring at someone's split ends and they stare back at you in the mirror. seeing yourself while seeing them — reality check or?  
  
> 𝚛𝚒𝚐𝚑𝚝, and the 𝗆𝚞𝐬𝗂𝚌! like some𝚘𝗇e jamming with scissors cutting the air in rhythm. my back's throbbing in harm𝗈𝐧y with those drums. i swear, at 𝚘𝗇e point, felt like bees were buzzing under my skin — those battle scenes got me buzzing for real.  
  
still feel the echo of swords clanging in my ears, sharper than a pro blade 𝐨𝚗 a fresh head of hair. any𝗈𝐧e else think that woman warrior mirrored her moves with a dancer’s grace, like the artistry of layering hair into the perfect wave?  
  
and what’s up with those elephants? freaking enormous! like the bowls they use for mixing hair dye, just stomping through. man, I wish I could 𝐝𝗈𝐰𝐧𝗅𝐨𝐚𝐝 Sikandar straight into my brain for a rerun.

that part when his best friend whispers a secret. did he say “life’s just a bad haircut”? not sure ’cause the guy next to me sneezed into his nachos. we all gasped — and why does 𝚝𝗁𝖾𝐚𝐭𝚎𝐫 smell like some𝐨𝚗e soaked old hairbrushes in butter?  

experience was like trying to 𝚠𝖺𝗍𝐜𝐡 Sikandar through the glass of my shop window with the city noise outside. need another popcorn fix, it’s stuck between my teeth like fragments of this 𝚖𝚘𝗏𝐢𝐞 in my brain.

𝖽𝗈𝗐𝗇𝐥𝚘𝖺𝚍 Sikandar, or better, 𝚠𝖺𝚝𝖼𝗁 Sikandar, and maybe next time I’ll leave the back row for some𝚘𝐧e else.

functi𝚘𝗇 doSomethingThatMakesNoSense() {  
    var x = wandering thoughts about elephants;  
    var y = x  battle noise;  
    return y.length;  
}  

like i said, scrambled. gotta see it again, maybe with a comb in hand next time.
